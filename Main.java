    /* program notes/preliminary logic:
     *  - need to make it so that character automatically keeps going forward
     *  - 2d game, character can only go up and down (maybe a bird??)
     *  - add obstacles later, just make sure that character keeps going forward
     *  - need to design character and background (something pixelated, y2k style)
     *  - player object, make screen little smaller than laptop monitor size, etc.
